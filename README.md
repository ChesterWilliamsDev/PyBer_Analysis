# PyBer_Analysis
# Overview
* We have been tasked with creating a new summary DataFrame for the ride-sharing data by city type. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we have created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. This analysis has been performed to highlight the changes in fares week by week for each city type. Ultimately, showing areas of opportunity for decision-makers.
# Results
# # Urban cities led the measurements across the board for the totals, then suburban,  and finally rural. With 1,625 rides, 2,405 drivers and $39,854.38 in total fares, urban cities far outpace the other city types. A far second, suburban had 625 total rides, 490 total drivers, and $19,356.33 in total fares. Rural cities were last in all total categories measured. With 125 total rides, 78 total drivers, and $4,327.93 in total fares, rural cites make up a small proportion of Pyberâ€™s active regions. 
# # When comparing averages per ride and per driver the rankings flip. Rural leads all measures. Average fares per ride are close with rural cities having $34.62 per ride and suburban having $30.97 per ride, with urban cities having $24.52 per ride. The greatest disparity shows up in average fare per driver. Rural cities have the highest average with $55.49 per ride then suburban with $39.50 per ride, and urban with $16.57 per ride. 
# # Density may have a significant influence on the total rides and total drivers. The comparison of average fare shows that the increased rides reduce the overall cost basis for all fares. An increase in the cost of a rural ride should be expected due to the distance between stops in rural areas, but the lack of drivers compared to rides may indicate pent up demand. 
# Summary
# # Recommendation 1
# # # Additional analysis is recommended to analyze how many rides are given by drivers. The data indicates that urban drivers make a significant amount less per ride, yet when total drivers are compared with total rides, there is a significant amount of drivers that have not given a ride. There could be an opportunity to meet pent up demand in other regions. 
# # Recommendation 2
# # # Additional analysis is recommended for the time of day of rides occur. Travel in urban regions occur from the early morning to after midnight. Understanding each regions riding behavior throughout the day could expose pent up demand in the suburban and rural regions due to the lack of drivers. 
# # Recommendation 3
# # # Additional analysis is recommended for cancellations. Urban cities are most fares for Pyber for the measured time frame. However, there are additional drivers willing to provide rides for the company. Investigation into cancellations could provide useful information about pent up demand in all city types. Rural and suburban cities may be dealing with a driver shortage, or the urban region could have additional demand when drivers are not.
